        description: `In this paper, an adaptive weights receding horizon control (AWRHC) for trajectory tracking of a robot is presented. Because of the physical constraints of the robot, the conventional receding horizon control (RHC) may result in some perturbations from the reference trajectory when it is near the desired trajectory. The adaptive weights adjust the preferences for the way-points selected from the reference trajectory. The simulation results of RHC were compared with AWRHC for straight and circular trajectory tracking. The evaluation of both RHC strategies were carried out by Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). The AWRHC approach significantly reduces perturbations which results in quicker path following with lower path transverse at the cost of negligible increase in computation time. <br /><br /><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9240398/authors#authors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary hover:underline font-medium">View Publication on IEEE Xplore →</a>`,

Multi-UAV collaboration improves the efficiency of the system and increases the chance of capturing the ball robustly in short span of time. In this paper, the proposed architecture is validated through simulation in ROS-Gazebo environment and is further implemented on hardware. <br /><br /><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01588" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary hover:underline font-medium">View Publication on arXiv →</a>`,

        testimonial: `Rahul Ravichandran worked with me in the preparatory phase of MBZIRC, an international robotics competition held at Abu Dhabi, 2020. He developed code stacks mainly for challenges 1 and 2, performed simulations in Gazebo, and tested them on drones. He is one among the most dedicated individuals I have worked with! He is an amazing learner and a smart team mate. He is capable of managing multiple projects simultaneously. It was indeed a joy to work with Rahul!`,
