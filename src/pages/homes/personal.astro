        description: `In this paper, an adaptive weights receding horizon control (AWRHC) for trajectory tracking of a robot is presented. Because of the physical constraints of the robot, the conventional receding horizon control (RHC) may result in some perturbations from the reference trajectory when it is near the desired trajectory. The adaptive weights adjust the preferences for the way-points selected from the reference trajectory. The simulation results of RHC were compared with AWRHC for straight and circular trajectory tracking. The evaluation of both RHC strategies were carried out by Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). The AWRHC approach significantly reduces perturbations which results in quicker path following with lower path transverse at the cost of negligible increase in computation time. <br /><br /><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9240398/authors#authors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary hover:underline font-medium">View Publication on IEEE Xplore →</a>`,

This problem is motivated from the challenge 1 of Mohammed Bin Zayed International Robotic Challenge 2020. The UAVs utilise visual feedback to autonomously detect target, approach it and capture without disturbing the vehicle which carries the target. Multi-UAV collaboration improves the efficiency of the system and increases the chance of capturing the ball robustly in short span of time. In this paper, the proposed architecture is validated through simulation in ROS-Gazebo environment and is further implemented on hardware. <br /><br /><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01588" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary hover:underline font-medium">View Publication on arXiv →</a>`,
